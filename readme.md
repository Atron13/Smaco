## SMACO - Simple Instruction Computer

Smaco is a concept in System Programming.
Simple Instruction Computer (SMACO) is a hypothetical machine with a small but effective instruction set that can be used illustrate the design of simple software processors involved in development of programs for providing the load, run, read, print commands.

## Features -

	1 Can perform any problem written in the machine language code
	2 Many validation are added but more can be added
	3 Seperate file are added for commands and for inputs
	4 Instruction are to be added
	5 Provide the instruction set for user

## Requirement -

	1 PyQt5
	2 Python3
	3 Any Code editor
	
## Commands -

	0	stop
	1	add
